# Multi-Agent Chat Application Implementation

## Current Focus: OpenAI Agents SDK Integration

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Set up basic Next.js application with TypeScript
- [x] Implement user authentication with NextAuth and Google OAuth
- [x] Create agent context and provider
- [x] Implement basic chat interface
- [x] Set up environment variables for OpenAI API
- [x] Create agent configurations for different agent types
- [x] Implement chat API route with OpenAI Agents SDK
- [x] Create OpenAI initialization component
- [x] Fix environment variable handling
- [x] Remove custom BusinessAgent implementation in favor of OpenAI Agents SDK

### In Progress
- [x] Test end-to-end chat functionality
- [x] Implement unified error handling strategy
- [x] Review and secure all API routes
- [x] Refactor components to separate concerns (Chat components)
- [ ] Standardize TypeScript types across the codebase
- [ ] Implement agent handoff functionality
- [ ] Add error boundaries and loading states
- [ ] Implement message persistence
- [ ] Add unit tests

### Backlog
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add analytics for message tracking
- [ ] Implement chat history
- [ ] Add support for file uploads
- [ ] Implement user feedback system
- [ ] Optimize React components with memoization
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Improve code documentation with JSDoc
- [ ] Update README with latest project structure

## Code Quality Improvements
- [x] Remove custom BusinessAgent implementation (#1)
- [x] Clean up unused workspaces (#3)
- [ ] Fix environment variable inconsistencies (#2)
  - [ ] Remove hardcoded API keys
  - [ ] Standardize NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix usage
- [ ] Improve code organization (#7)
  - [ ] Separate concerns in components
  - [ ] Standardize file structure
- [ ] Performance optimizations (#8)
  - [ ] Identify unnecessary re-renders
  - [ ] Implement React.memo where beneficial
- [ ] Testing (#9)
  - [ ] Add unit tests for components
  - [ ] Add integration tests for API routes
  - [ ] Add end-to-end tests
- [ ] Documentation (#10)
  - [ ] Add JSDoc to all components and functions
  - [ ] Document API endpoints
  - [ ] Create architecture documentation

## Known Issues
- [x] ~~Need to verify all environment variables are properly loaded in production~~ (Completed in previous session)
- [x] ~~Consider adding input validation for chat messages~~ (Added in previous session)
- [x] ~~Need to implement proper error handling for API failures~~ (Added in previous session)
- [ ] Some TypeScript types need standardization (In Progress)
- [x] ~~Some components may have mixed concerns that need refactoring~~ (Refactored chat components)

## Next Steps
1. Test the chat functionality with different agent types
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Add loading states for better UX
4. Set up proper logging for debugging
5. Write unit tests for critical components
