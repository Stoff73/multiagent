# Story 1.4: Federated Sign-out and Session Cleanup

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a user  
- I want to securely sign out from all federated authentication providers  
- so that my session is fully terminated and no residual tokens or sessions remain active.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. User can initiate sign-out that revokes tokens from all federated providers.  
2. Local session and cookies are cleared upon sign-out.  
3. Sign-out flow handles errors gracefully and informs the user if sign-out fails.  
4. Middleware or service cleans up any server-side session data related to the user.  
5. Sign-out integrates cleanly with existing authentication and session management flows.  
6. Proper logging is implemented for sign-out events and errors.  

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Implement federated sign-out logic for each supported provider (Google, Microsoft, etc.) (AC: 1, 5)  
- [x] Clear local session storage, cookies, and tokens on sign-out (AC: 2)  
- [x] Implement server-side session cleanup middleware or service (AC: 4)  
- [x] Handle and log errors during sign-out process (AC: 3, 6)  
- [x] Integrate sign-out flow into frontend UI components (AC: 5)  
- [x] Write unit tests for sign-out logic and middleware (AC: 1, 4, 5)  
- [x] Write integration tests simulating sign-out scenarios (AC: 1, 2, 3)  
- [x] Perform manual testing for complete session termination and error handling (AC: 3)  

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights  
Builds on authentication and session management flows established in Story 1.2 (Federated Sign-in) and Story 1.3 (JWT Refresh Middleware).

### Data Models  
Session and token data models as per architecture/5-data-models-simplified.md.

### API Specifications  
Refer to architecture/4-key-services.md for authentication and session management APIs.

### Component Specifications  
Sign-out logic to be implemented in backend service layer and frontend UI components.

### File Locations  
- `multiagent/src/lib/oauth/signOut.ts` (new sign-out logic)  
- `multiagent/src/lib/middleware/sessionCleanupMiddleware.ts` (new middleware for session cleanup)  
- Frontend sign-out button and handlers in `multiagent/src/components/SignOutButton.tsx`  

### Testing Requirements  
- Unit tests with Jest for sign-out logic and middleware  
- Integration tests simulating federated sign-out and session cleanup  
- Manual tests for full session termination and error scenarios  

### Technical Constraints  
- Sign-out must complete promptly without significant latency  
- Must comply with security best practices for token revocation and session cleanup (architecture/9-security-compliance.md)  

### Security/Compliance  
- Ensure tokens are revoked securely at provider endpoints  
- Prevent residual session data that could lead to unauthorized access  

### Project Structure Notes  
- Follow existing authentication and middleware patterns in the codebase  
- Coordinate with authentication and frontend teams for integration  

### Deviation Analysis  
No deviations expected from architecture or epic requirements.  

## Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%  
- [x] Integration Tests: location: next to sign-out and session cleanup modules  
- [x] Manual Test Steps:  
  - Verify tokens are revoked at federated providers  
  - Verify local session and cookies are cleared  
  - Simulate sign-out errors and verify user notification and logging  
  - Verify server-side session data is cleaned up
