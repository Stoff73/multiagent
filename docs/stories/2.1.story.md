# Story 2.1: Dashboard Shell & Grid Layout

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a signed-in user  
- I want to see my agents in a grid layout on the dashboard  
- so that I can quickly launch and manage them efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Responsive 2-column grid layout on large (≥ lg) screens.  
2. Each agent card displays an icon, name, and accent stripe.  
3. Dashboard loads within 1 second on staging environment.  
4. Grid layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.  
5. Accessibility standards are met for keyboard and screen reader users.  

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Design and implement responsive grid layout for agent cards (AC: 1, 4)  
- [ ] Create agent card components with icon, name, and accent stripe (AC: 2)  
- [ ] Optimize dashboard load performance (AC: 3)  
- [ ] Implement accessibility features for grid and cards (AC: 5)  
- [ ] Write unit tests for grid layout and agent card components (AC: 1, 2, 4, 5)  
- [ ] Perform manual testing for responsiveness, accessibility, and performance (AC: 3, 5)  

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context  
Part of Epic E-2: Agent Hub UI.

### Data Models  
Agent metadata includes icon, name, and status.

### API Specifications  
Dashboard data fetched from agent management APIs.

### Component Specifications  
Grid and card components implemented in frontend React components.

### File Locations  
- `multiagent/src/components/DashboardGrid.tsx` (grid layout component)  
- `multiagent/src/components/AgentCard.tsx` (agent card component)  

### Testing Requirements  
- Unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library.  
- Manual tests for responsiveness and accessibility.  

### Technical Constraints  
- Must support modern browsers and responsive design principles.  
- Performance target: load time ≤ 1 second on staging.  

### Security/Compliance  
- Ensure no sensitive data is exposed in agent cards.  
- Follow accessibility best practices.  

### Project Structure Notes  
- Follow existing frontend component patterns.  
- Coordinate with UI/UX and frontend teams.  

### Deviation Analysis  
No deviations expected from epic or product requirements.  

## Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: coverage requirement 80%  
- [ ] Manual Tests: responsiveness, accessibility, performance
