# Story 1.6: User Session Management Dashboard

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a user  
- I want to view and manage all my active sessions across devices and platforms  
- so that I can monitor and control where my account is signed in for security and convenience.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Users can see a list of all active sessions with details such as device type, location, and last activity.  
2. Users can remotely sign out from any active session.  
3. The dashboard updates in real-time or near real-time to reflect session changes.  
4. Access to the session management dashboard requires re-authentication or MFA challenge.  
5. Proper error handling and user feedback are provided during session management actions.  
6. Session management integrates cleanly with existing authentication and session flows.  

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Design session management dashboard UI and user experience (AC: 1, 3, 4)  
- [ ] Implement backend APIs to fetch and manage user sessions (AC: 1, 2, 3, 6)  
- [ ] Implement frontend components for session listing and remote sign-out (AC: 1, 2, 5)  
- [ ] Implement security checks for dashboard access (AC: 4)  
- [ ] Write unit tests for backend and frontend session management components (AC: 1, 2, 4, 6)  
- [ ] Write integration tests simulating session management scenarios (AC: 2, 5)  
- [ ] Perform manual testing for session visibility, remote sign-out, and security enforcement (AC: 4, 5)  

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights  
Builds on authentication, session management, and MFA flows established in Stories 1.2 through 1.5.

### Data Models  
Extend session data models to include metadata for device, location, and activity (architecture/5-data-models-simplified.md).

### API Specifications  
Refer to architecture/4-key-services.md for session management APIs.

### Component Specifications  
Session management logic to be implemented in backend services and frontend UI components.

### File Locations  
- `multiagent/src/lib/session/sessionService.ts` (backend session management)  
- `multiagent/src/components/SessionDashboard.tsx` (frontend dashboard UI)  

### Testing Requirements  
- Unit tests with Jest for session management backend and frontend components  
- Integration tests simulating session listing and remote sign-out  
- Manual tests for dashboard access security and session control  

### Technical Constraints  
- Dashboard must load session data efficiently without significant latency  
- Must comply with security best practices for session management (architecture/9-security-compliance.md)  

### Security/Compliance  
- Ensure session data is protected and only accessible by the authenticated user  
- Prevent unauthorized session termination or data leakage  

### Project Structure Notes  
- Follow existing authentication and UI component patterns  
- Coordinate with authentication and frontend teams for integration  

### Deviation Analysis  
No deviations expected from architecture or epic requirements.  

## Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%  
- [ ] Integration Tests: location: next to session management modules  
- [ ] Manual Test Steps:  
  - Verify session list accuracy and details  
  - Test remote sign-out functionality  
  - Verify dashboard access security and MFA enforcement
