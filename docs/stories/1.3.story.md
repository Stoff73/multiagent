# Story 1.3: JWT Refresh Middleware

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a user  
- I want my authentication session to be seamlessly maintained  
- so that I do not have to frequently re-login when my JWT expires.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Middleware intercepts requests with expired JWTs and attempts token refresh using refresh tokens.  
2. On successful refresh, new JWT is issued and request proceeds transparently.  
3. On refresh failure (e.g., invalid or expired refresh token), user is logged out and redirected to login.  
4. Middleware securely handles tokens to prevent leaks or replay attacks.  
5. Middleware integrates cleanly with existing authentication and session management flows.  
6. Proper logging and error handling are implemented for refresh failures.  

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement JWT refresh middleware (AC: 1, 2, 4, 5)  
  - [ ] Detect expired JWTs in incoming requests  
  - [ ] Validate and use refresh tokens to obtain new JWTs  
  - [ ] Replace expired JWT with new JWT in request context  
  - [ ] Ensure secure handling of tokens in memory and transport  
- [ ] Integrate middleware into authentication flow (AC: 5)  
- [ ] Implement error handling and user logout on refresh failure (AC: 3, 6)  
- [ ] Add logging for refresh attempts and failures (AC: 6)  
- [ ] Write unit tests for middleware logic (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)  
- [ ] Write integration tests covering end-to-end refresh scenarios (AC: 1, 2, 3, 5)  
- [ ] Perform manual testing for session continuity and failure cases (AC: 3)  

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights  
Builds on authentication flows established in Story 1.2 (Federated Sign-in).  

### Data Models  
Tokens and session data models as per architecture/5-data-models-simplified.md.  

### API Specifications  
Refer to architecture/4-key-services.md for authentication service APIs.  

### Component Specifications  
Middleware component to be implemented in backend service layer, integrated with auth handlers.  

### File Locations  
- `multiagent/src/lib/middleware/jwtRefreshMiddleware.ts` (new middleware file)  
- Authentication flow files in `multiagent/src/lib/oauth/`  

### Testing Requirements  
- Unit tests with Jest for middleware logic  
- Integration tests simulating token expiry and refresh  
- Manual tests for session continuity and logout on failure  

### Technical Constraints  
- Middleware must not introduce significant latency  
- Must comply with security best practices for token handling (architecture/9-security-compliance.md)  

### Security/Compliance  
- Ensure refresh tokens are stored and transmitted securely  
- Prevent replay attacks and token leakage  

### Project Structure Notes  
- Follow existing middleware patterns in the codebase  
- Coordinate with authentication team for integration  

### Deviation Analysis  
No deviations expected from architecture or epic requirements.  

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%  
- [ ] Integration Tests: location: next to middleware and auth modules  
- [ ] Manual Test Steps:  
  - Simulate expired JWT and verify refresh occurs transparently  
  - Simulate invalid/expired refresh token and verify user logout and redirect  
  - Verify logs for refresh attempts and failures
