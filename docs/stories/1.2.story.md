# Story P-1.2: Federated Sign-in (Google & Microsoft)

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a user
- I want to sign in using Google or Microsoft accounts
- so that I can easily access the app without creating a new account

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Users can sign in using Google OAuth.
2. Users can sign in using Microsoft OAuth.
3. On successful sign-in, user records are persisted in the database.
4. Proper error handling is implemented for OAuth failures.
5. Users are redirected appropriately after sign-in.
6. Sign-in UI clearly shows options for Google and Microsoft.
7. Security best practices are followed for OAuth tokens.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement Google OAuth sign-in flow (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Integrate Google OAuth SDK or API
  - [ ] Handle OAuth token retrieval and validation
- [ ] Implement Microsoft OAuth sign-in flow (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Integrate Microsoft OAuth SDK or API
  - [ ] Handle OAuth token retrieval and validation
- [ ] Persist user records on successful sign-in (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create or update user record in database
- [ ] Implement error handling for OAuth failures (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Display user-friendly error messages
  - [ ] Log errors for monitoring
- [ ] Implement post-sign-in redirection (AC: 5)
- [ ] Update UI to show Google and Microsoft sign-in options (AC: 6)
- [ ] Ensure OAuth tokens are handled securely (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes

This story requires integration with Google and Microsoft OAuth providers. Developers should refer to official OAuth documentation for each provider. User persistence should ensure idempotency to avoid duplicate records. Error handling should cover network issues, invalid tokens, and user cancellations.

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Integration Test: location: next to OAuth handler modules
- [ ] Cypress E2E: location: /e2e/federated-signin.test.ts

Manual Test Steps:

- Manually test sign-in flows with valid and invalid credentials for both Google and Microsoft.
- Verify user record creation and updates in the database.
- Confirm error messages display correctly on OAuth failures.
- Validate redirection after sign-in.
